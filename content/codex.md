## 📖 Code Fragments from the Book

- “Truth is what remains when all layers fall. Sovereignty is living accordingly.”
- “Every chain has a lock. Every lock has a code. Every code has a breach.”
- “Privacy is not escape. It is presence, purified.”
- “You do not protest the algorithm — you outgrow it.”

## 🔑 Core Principles

- **Sovereignty begins in silence.**
- **Consent is sacred, or null.**
- **Reputation > regulation.**
- **Open is not weak. It is weaponized trust.**
- **Autarchy is not retreat. It is root access.**
