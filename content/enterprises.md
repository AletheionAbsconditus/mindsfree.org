## ✦ What Is an Autarchic Enterprise?

An enterprise that doesn't serve shareholders or seek domination.  
It serves a field, a function, a community — **without coercion**.

Types include:

- 🌀 DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
- 🤝 Cooperatives & Collectives
- 🛖 Ethical Refuges & Retreat Spaces
- 🧪 Lab-like Projects or Pop-up Guilds

## ✦ How to Start

1. Define the field you want to serve (food, ethics, tech, care)
2. Choose the structure (solo, guild, DAO, co-op)
3. Use tools that match your ethos
4. Publish your mission and be visible
5. Invite aligned people — no permission needed

> You don’t “open a company” — you **ignite an alignment**.
