## 1. We are not anarchists. We are not statists. We are autarchists.
- We embrace personal sovereignty without domination or submission.

## 2. Autarchy begins within.
- Self-mastery is the source of external freedom.  
- There is no liberty without responsibility.

## 3. Consent is sacred.
- All systems rooted in coercion are illegitimate.  
- Voluntarism is the only valid currency.

## 4. We don’t fight for liberty — we embody it.
- We don’t vote for change — we build parallel systems.  
- We don’t seek leaders — we cultivate alignment.

## 5. Creation is sacred.
- We remix, we fork, we share.  
- Open source. Open knowledge. Open culture.

## 6. The digital realm is our extension, not our prison.
- We use cryptography and peer-to-peer tools not to escape — but to reclaim.

## 7. We are not against systems. We are beyond them.
- When scripts end, we write poetry.  
- When institutions fall, we raise gardens.

## 8. Autarchy is not isolation. It is interdependence without domination.
- We collaborate without contracts.  
- We serve without being asked.

## 9. Our revolution is invisible.
- It has no flags. No slogans.  
- It pulses in encrypted whispers and borderless dreams.

## 10. The Autarchist does not conquer the world — they transcend it.
- We are not the opposition. We are the seed of what comes next.
