I want to be born old  
and die young, in full vitality.

I rise from the ashes of doubt  
with bones carved by battle  
and a soul untouched —  
like a child who still believes.

I walk among the ruins of the old world  
not as one who mourns,  
but as one who sows.

I carry in my eyes  
the memory of the whip —  
but also the gleam  
of those who never bowed.

Every scar is a letter of manumission  
handwritten in the ink of persistence.

I was not taught to resist —  
I relearned it through every fall,  
every loss not grieved  
but reforged into foundation.

I am what remains when all collapses.  
I am what reemerges  
when no one else believes.

I am the flame that outlives the storm,  
the clay that refuses to be sculpted.

I want to be born old and die young,  
with the boldness of a child unafraid to fail,  
and the courage of an elder  
who has seen too much  
to be seduced by golden chains.

For where others see end,  
I see crack.  
Where there are bars, I plant wings.  
Where there's a decree, I dream the alternative.

My homeland is unyielding hope.  
My constitution: integrity.  
And my banner is the one of lived freedom —  
woven in each stubborn gesture  
of one who refuses to surrender the soul.
