> *You don’t apply for a role in a sovereign network.  
You recognize your function — and start building.*

## ✦ What Is This?

This is the **living map of autarchic action**.

It is divided into two primary paths:

### 🧍 Individual Roles (Professions)
Personal, direct, nomadic or local contributions.  
Hands-on, ethical, intentional — aligned with presence and skill.

### 🛠️ Organized Networks (Guilds)
Groups, cooperatives, or DAOs with replicable structures.  
They serve, coordinate, and scale voluntary, peer-based action.

## ✦ Fields of Operation

Each profession or guild is embedded in a **strategic field** of sovereignty:

- 🌱 Food & Fermentation  
- 🏡 Habitats & Shared Spaces  
- 💊 Health & Ancestral Care  
- 🔐 Digital Privacy  
- 📡 Communication & Infrastructure  
- 🧘 Retreats & Inner Work  
- 🧾 Peer Certification  
- 📚 Free Education  
- 🌍 P2P Networks  
- 🛒 Production & Exchange  
- 🧩 DAO & Ethical Governance

> Each field is more than economic — it is an axis of autonomy.

## ✦ What Each Role Contains

- **Field** – The domain of sovereignty  
- **Type of Structure** – DAO, cooperative, individual, sanctuary, etc.  
- **Practical Description** – What it delivers or enables  
- **Tools** – Platforms, protocols, or philosophies used

---

## ✦ Why Does This Exist?

- To help you **recognize** where you already act  
- To help you **align** with others  
- To inspire **replication** and ethical action  
- To **test tools** in the real world  
- To **map yourself** in the post-system terrain

> **You are not a resource.  
You are a live function within a living network.**
