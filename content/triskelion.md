# 🌀 The Autarchist Triskelion

This is not just a symbol. It’s a **vibrational cipher**.

Each spiral represents a core axis of sovereignty:
- **Mind** – clarity and philosophical self-ownership  
- **Body** – health, privacy, self-defense  
- **Presence** – legacy, service, silent action  

Above it floats the triangle — the eternal principle of **conscious creation**.

## 📖 Interpretation
This symbol echoes ancestral wisdom and digital evolution.  
It belongs to no flag, no faction. It belongs to those who live the code.

It is our quiet banner.  
Our sigil of alignment.  
Our mirror and map.
