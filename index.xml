      <description>“We do not seek chaos, nor submit to imposed order.”
“We build inner harmony and radiate it as a quiet force.”
 1. We are not anarchists. We are not statists. We are autarchists.  We embrace personal sovereignty without domination or submission.  2. Autarchy begins within.  Self-mastery is the source of external freedom. There is no liberty without responsibility.  3. Consent is sacred.  All systems rooted in coercion are illegitimate.</description>

      <description>🌀 The Autarchist Triskelion This is not just a symbol. It’s a vibrational cipher.
Each spiral represents a core axis of sovereignty:
 Mind – clarity and philosophical self-ownership Body – health, privacy, self-defense Presence – legacy, service, silent action  Above it floats the triangle — the eternal principle of conscious creation.
 🖼️ Symbol Variants Black &amp;amp; White Metallic  📖 Interpretation This symbol echoes ancestral wisdom and digital evolution.</description>
